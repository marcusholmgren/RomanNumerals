# Roman Numeral Converter Project

This project provides tools to convert numbers between Roman numerals and standard Arabic numerals. It includes implementations in various languages.

The first version of this program was written in CoffeeScript, and a more recent version has been implemented in Rust.

## Implementations

### Rust

A command-line tool implemented in Rust for converting between Roman numerals and Arabic numbers. This version features robust parsing, validation of Roman numerals, and a comprehensive test suite.

For detailed instructions on building, running, and testing the Rust version, including CLI examples, please see the [Rust README](rust/README.md).

*The original README for the Rust version (which included basic Rust usage instructions) has been expanded and moved to `rust/README.md`.*
